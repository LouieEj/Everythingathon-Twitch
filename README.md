# Everythingathon-Twitch
A timer for an "Everythingathon" for streaming platform Twitch.
The stream lasts as long as the timer does not hit 0, and different events adds more time to the timer.
An Everythingathon is similar to a Subathon, but in a Subathon only subscriptions add time to the timer, whereas in an Everythingathon other events add time too (following, cheering bits, donating, raiding).
